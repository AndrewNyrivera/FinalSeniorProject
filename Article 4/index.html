							<h2>Global Commons Preservation</h2>
							<h4>Lit Review</h4>
							<h8>By, Andrew Rivera</h8>

						<div class="content">
							<h2>Intro</h2>
							<p>With the lack of regulations over the global commons, there has been a constant battle which is leading to a fast decrease in the commons. The global commons has become a first come first serve basis when it comes to individuals exploiting them; this has lead to a fast pass decline in the commons, which can lead to all of our commons being depleted forever. The purpose of this paper is to address the issues with the exploitation of global commons and to show how regulations of these commons can be done to save them. This paper is divided into three main sections; the first section deals with the issues revolving around our current global commons and the direction its heading in. The second section will deal with how the global commons may affect the countries and the whole world. Lastly, the third section will go over the different solutions for regulating/preserving our global commons and how these solutions could possibly change things.
								<h2>Importance Of Global Common Preservation</h2>
									<br>
									Global commons are the natural resources like the ocean, air, and space in which aren’t owned by one individual entity. Bodnar and Salathe (2012) found that there is an abundance of natural resources, but the overall abuse and control over the commons are leading towards an extinction of these resources as a whole. Although the commons is an essential part of all our all human lives it's being depleted by individuals who are reaping the benefits without sharing the costs. The individual selfish benefits could lead to the complete extinction of the commons as a whole. For example,  clean natural resources in highly populated areas require some forms of waste control - the associated costs are generally shared by everyone in the area, but the benefits of the clean resources are also shared by everyone in the area (Bodnar & Salathé, 2012). The strategic sharing of clean resources is the goal for global commons but the problem occurs when individuals start to take advantage. The damage in which can ensue from global commons exploitation would be air pollution, mass depletion in food, the depletion of animal and human pollution. Global commons is the vital ecological functions that they perform for the Earth and its population (Schrijver, N. 2016). The essential ecological function in which the commons are apart of shows the importance of preservation. 
									In addition to the importance of the global commons to our well being, it also has an importance in economics. The global commons is seen as an essential part for economic expansion at a global level because of its role with globalization. With the limiting trade and economic growth, we find that globalization can help to improve upon these issues. Globalization helps to share the commons instead of it being controlled by individual entities, so there is not control nor abuse (Byrne, J., & Glover, L. 2002).  The increasing population is challenging the distorted and narrow values of an economic system, which seem to only serve a small elite. (Cumbers, A. 2015).  Global commons can be seen to help with economic expansion and with an increase in population, the preservation of the commons becomes a must.
								<h2>Preservation Of The Commons</h2>
								<br>
									Among the many problems revolving around commons preservation, many solutions have come with it. One of which presents a punishment system that will essentially penalize anyone in which takes advantage of the commons (Bodnar, T., & Salathé, M. 2012).  The goal of this system is to lessen the amount of abuse towards the commons and more or less force people into working together therefore preventing any one individual from taking control. California introduced an ambitious system requiring vessels within 24 nautical miles off its coast to use cleaner marine fuels (fuel could not exceed 0.1% sulfur) (Kopela, S. 2016). This system will prevent pollution by individuals from entering into the Californian waters without a clean fuel source so the commons don’t get damaged. The enhancement of security in local environments and local livelihoods in the developing world would help to combat the intense depletion of commons particularly in the rangelands (Shikui Dong, Wolf, 2017).  Applying some important applied research questions that support adaptive management would also help with not the continuation of common preservation. The applied research questions will work as a motivation for third world countries to keep the commons preserved for the long run.
								<h2>Complications of Global Commons Preservation </h2>
								<br>
									While there are many solutions for global common preservation, they all come with certain complications. (Kopela, S. 2016) With the Port-state jurisdiction it can be used to prevent ships from spreading pollution, and punish those who exploit the commons, but it is limited to international waters and becomes ineffective. The punishment of people who abuse the commons seems to be a good solution, but if the jurisdiction doesn’t work out it becomes ineffective and complications occur. The international jurisdiction would cause complications for third world countries because their commons would be destroyed, therefore, not allowing for countries to develop. (Schrijver, N.2016) The initiative of developing countries, it has now been replaced by a new law of international cooperation and protection of natural wealth and resources beyond the limits of national jurisdiction. The creation of a law that goes beyond the limits of national jurisdiction would help to protect developing countries against initiative attempts against the commons. The problem with this is getting an agreement on a national level to create a law that would permit other countries into going past jurisdiction, seeing that the united states are divided itself, so it is very implausible for that to be done on an international level. 
								<br>
								<h2>Conclusion </h2>
									The overwhelming effects in which the global commons has on the world, give a definitive reason in which why we should be preserving the commons. Also, we covered how single individuals actions against the commons can have server impact on others. We showed the preservation attempts in which systems were made such as punishments and laws that go beyond the jurisdictions on a national level. The last point was how the preservation solutions have complications within them, like getting countries to work together to allow for a law that goes beyond jurisdiction is very unlikely and can cause even more complications.
									The evidence revolving around the importance of the commons gives me a major reason to be interested in preserving the commons. Such reasons being air pollution, and mass depletion in food supplies, but the main point that got to me was the correlation it has to the human population because it gives a definitive reason in which to care about the problem. The preservation attempts such as the punishment system from Bodnar, T., & Salathé, M shows a unique way of dealing with the problem but also shows the faults of the system. Showing the fault of the systems allows for more of an appreciation for the system and understanding that there isn’t a perfect solution. The complication of the preservation attempts like with the law that would be beyond jurisdiction comes with many complications like country cooperation. The complications of the solutions allow for a more in-depth understanding of how these solutions would work and other problems that can occur.
									This problem with global commons should pique the interest of everyone because it is a problem that will affect everyone in the world. In particular people who like and care about the environment and the inhabitants within them. The main reasons why people should care about this issues are because the commons is something in which we all have access to and will be affected by, whether it’s good or bad. This info is beneficial for all people who want to see the environment stay alive and for all the people that want to stay alive themselves because the Commons has a global presence and will affect everyone negatively if abused.
